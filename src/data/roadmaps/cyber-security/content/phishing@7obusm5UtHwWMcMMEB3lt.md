What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. This is usually done by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.
Common Phishing Techniques

    Email Phishing: The most common type, where attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources. These emails often contain links to fake websites designed to steal personal information.

    Spear Phishing: A more targeted form of phishing where the attacker tailors the attack to a specific individual or organization. These attacks often include personal information to make the scam more convincing.

    Whaling: A type of spear phishing aimed at high-profile targets like executives or other key figures within an organization.

    Smishing: Phishing conducted via SMS (text messaging). Attackers send messages that lure recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing personal information.

    Vishing: Phishing conducted via voice calls. Attackers may use social engineering techniques to obtain personal information over the phone.

    Clone Phishing: Attackers create a nearly identical replica of a legitimate email that has been previously sent but with malicious links or attachments.

Phishing Indicators

    Generic Greetings: Emails that do not address the recipient by name.
    Urgency and Threats: Messages that create a sense of urgency or fear, such as threats to close your account or fines.
    Suspicious Links: Links that do not match the domain of the legitimate website. Hovering over the link reveals a different URL.
    Attachments: Unexpected or suspicious attachments, especially with common file extensions like .exe, .zip, or .docx.
    Grammar and Spelling Errors: Poorly written messages with noticeable errors.
    Mismatched Email Addresses: The email address of the sender does not match the organization they claim to represent.
